# web-scraper
- Code up a web scraper that can automate the process of manually using the site.

### Featured Tasks and Requirements
- Scrape a Wikipedia page of your choosing and record which passages need citations.
    - E.g. History of Mexico has a few “citations needed”.
- Your web scraper should report the number of citations needed.
- Your web scraper should identify those cases AND include the relevant passage.
     - E.g. Citation needed for “lorem spam and impsum eggs”
- Consider the “relevant passage” to be the parent element that contains the passage, often a paragraph element.
